<b>Conclusion</b>
After all the Stats Generation, and running successfully for a month the website went offline and turned out to be a scam and thus due to unavoidable circumstances the project failed to generate me any revenue, my efforts practically being futile; Though looking back, the experience I gained during the development of the application prepared me for my future projects.
